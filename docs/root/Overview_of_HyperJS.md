## What is HyperJS?
HyperJS is a framework/build system for JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages.
It helps make the lives of NodeJS developers easier by creating a very intuitive CLI service, and providing many packages to use!

## Why we Made HyperJS?
We wanted to make a framework that was easy to use, and easy to learn.
Skylix is a company that makes it easy to talk and communicate with your friends, family, community members, and more!
You may wonder why a company developing a chat platform would make a framework?
Well, Skylix at its core is made up of developers, and as an Open Source company, we wanted to make a framework for everyone to use, whether you make mobile, desktop, web or even game control apps, HyperJS can be customized to your needs!
